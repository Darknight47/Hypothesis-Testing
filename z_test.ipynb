    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Determine the Significance level:  \n",
    "* **Significance Level(α)**: 0.05. This level is commonly used in hypothesis testing because it provides a balance between Type I error (false positive) and Type II error (false negative). It implies a 5% risk of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Calculate the Z-Score: The Z-score is calculated using the formula:  \n",
    "$$ Z = \\frac{\\bar X - \\mu}{\\frac{𝜎}{\\sqrt(n)}}$$  \n",
    "* Plugging in the values: $$ Z = \\frac{2.4 - 2.0}{\\frac{1.2}{\\sqrt(38)}} = {\\frac{0.4}{0.1945}} ≈ 2.06 $$  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Determine the critical value (s):\n",
    "For a two-tailed test with $\\alpha = 0.05$, the critical values are approximately $± 1.96$ (from Z-tables or standard normal distribution tables).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Make the decision\n",
    "* If $|Z| > 1.96$, we **reject** the null hypothesis.\n",
    "* If $|Z| ≤ 1.96$, we **fail to reject** the null hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our case, $|Z| = 2.06$, which is greater than $1.96$. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Conclusion\n",
    "Since $|Z| > 1.96$, we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is a significant difference between Arsenal's average goals per match and the hypothesized league average of 2.0 goals per match.\n"
